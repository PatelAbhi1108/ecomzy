Step 1 : Create react app 
Step 2 : Configure Tailwind CSS for this project
Step 3 : Install tailwind, React router DOM, React icons, React Redux toolkit for this project
Step 4.1 : Create required folders and file structure :
        here we need folders such as: 
            - Components -> it will contain all the components in the project ( Example: Navbar, Product, Cartitem )
            - pages -> it will contain all the pages in the project ( Example:Home, Cart )
            - redux -> it will contain all the functions required to maintain state in the form of slices 
Step 4.2 : In react folder create another folder name Slices which contain all the slices of this project
           And also create one file name as store.js which contain all the slices of this project
Step 5 : Wrap App component with provider in index.js file and pass store in provider parameter 
Step 6 : Now your React app is linked to the Redux now write the react code in their respective files
